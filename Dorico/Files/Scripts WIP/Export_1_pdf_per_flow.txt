 Prerisquite: your Print / Layouts + Destination + Job Type + Page Setup are properly settled

How it should work:

 - Setup
    - File / Project Info
    - Ignore Projet
    - While there are flows
        - Setup flow titles in an array
        - Count flow number
 - Print
    - ExpFlows = 0
    - While ExpFlows < FlowNum
        - Flow
        - Choose
        - Select none
        - Pick flow ExpFlows
        - OK
        - Export
        - inc ExpFlows

Problems:
 - How to store titles in an array from Dorico
 - How to know hom many flow are there
 - How to picl the right flow before exporting
